		The purpose of this paper is to explore differences in piano teaching
		between the United States and China. This paper examines the differences
		through both broad and narrow perspectives. It first examines the history of
		the development of general music education in the United States and China
		respectively, providing a background to the differences in piano education.
		​Then it discusses the dissimilarities in piano study from three outlooks:
		the parental influence, the students’ motivation, and how the study of music
		can improve one’s overall capacities. Additionally, I will compare the
		prevalent piano teaching theories of both countries, including teaching
		styles, materials, and syllabi. From the narrow side, I will contrast
		specific pedagogical diversities in private piano teaching between the USA
		and China. Finally, class piano and studio-class are examined to demonstrate
		the distinction between methods in the USA and China. I have analyzed the
		inconsistencies in piano teaching between these two countries. I hope that
		piano educators can efficiently identify the best teaching strategies by
		recognizing the essential ones and improving the inferior ones.

## Introduction

### Historical Summary of the Development of Music Education​
​
#### ​a. In the United States

Musical education in the United States has a long history. Back in the 18th century, music training had already started to develop and flourish in the United States. It first appeared in church, teaching basic information about reading music and singing. Later music became a curricular subject in schools. Music training improved quickly and by the 20th century  throughout the country, many public schools had music programs. Also, music education expanded to many levels, such as for preschool, elementary school, and high school. In higher education, Oberlin Conservatory, became the first college to offer the four-year Bachelor of  Music Education degree in the United States. (Stanford 2018) 

Furthermore, training in music became an increasingly significant component of human culture. Music education gradually became an equivalent field of study to such academic majors as economics and physics. It was not uncommon for students of all ages to pursue music study. Children learned singing or to play instruments by joining diverse types of ensemble activities from primary to secondary education, such as choir, school orchestra, and marching band. Moreover, music classes were offered as general music education for appreciating music. Students might have some opportunities to perform in music classes or activities. Hence, music  is often important while they study in school.

Professional music education at advanced levels led to bachelor, master, and doctoral degrees. The Bachelor of Music degree emphasizes performance as a major on a specific instrument or singing; the Bachelor of Music Education emphasizes teaching music. Professional music curricula generally include courses in theory, history, literature, pedagogy, and so on. Students get academic credits for completing these classes. They focus not only on learning to  identify the different musical styles, but also on music teaching methods. Piano education was historically popular and vital, because the piano played a fundamental role in understanding music theory, and because the piano could substitute for the full orchestra. The keyboard skills class is required for all non-piano major students in their first year at most universities.

Furthermore, physical facilities in American schools are more advanced than in many  other countries. Take piano as an example. American schools mostly offer grand pianos for piano major students to use for individual practice. In China, grand pianos usually are offered only in teachers’ studios due to the shortage of resources and spaces.

​In addition, many schools provide  only Steinway pianos in the practice rooms for students in America. Almost every classroom has  a piano and a computer with a projector and screen. 

#### ​b. In China 

Music education in other countries tends to become more common when their economics improve. This is true of South Korea, Japan, and China. However, the musical education in these countries is very different due to diverse politics and cultural backgrounds. China is an excellent example to fit this argument.

The development of education in China is complex. With over 1.3 billion people, the government faces a primary problem providing both food and education. As a consequence, improving agriculture and education are the most important tasks in China. In the educational area, the nine-year compulsory education system (from elementary school to junior high school) was approved by the Chinese government in the 1950s. (Su 2002, 36-38) Due to the large population, competitive  awareness existed everywhere.

Thus, the curricula were very specific and intense to keep  students’ academic pressure even in elementary school. Courses consisted of Chinese,  mathematics, nature, history, geography, music, drawing, and physical education. Also, those  courses will combine with practical activities, such as exercises for body and eyes relaxation, flag-raising ceremony, and marching band. The Chinese education was famous for its rigor, so  the study burden was significant for students. There was a large amount of homework for two to  four hours every day. At the end of a semester, non-academic classes, like music, drawing, and  physical education, were usually usurped by academic review sessions. Music class had a lower position than academic classes at that time.

However, the Chinese government reduced the study  burden in the 1990s, specifically for primary and secondary school students. It was thought important to provide reasonable time for students to strengthen various life experiences after school. As a result, literature and the arts have experienced a great increase since then.

#### c. The Introduction of Western Music to China 

The introduction of Western music changed Chinese musical history. Before Western  music was introduced to China, its musical world was completely different. The development of Chinese traditional music had an extremely long history and occupied a prominent cultural position. It focused on traditional instruments like the Erhu and Pipa, dances, folk songs, and Chinese operas until the early 19th century.

Although Western music formally arrived in China in 1601, when the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci presented a clavichord to the emperor of Ming  dynasty, (Melvin 2018) it did not become familiar until the end of Cultural Revolution in 1976 (Bonadio 2018). In 1979, the famous violinist Isaac Stern was the first American musician to visit China and collaborate with a Chinese symphony orchestra. (Stern 1999, 255-256)

This historical musical collaboration opened a new vista in China. Conservatories in China were founded and expanded rapidly. At present, there are nine  main conservatories, along the order of the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and Sichuan Conservatory of Music. The Shanghai Conservatory of Music was the first music school to teach Western techniques. (Bonadio op.cit.)

In some ways, Western music overtook Chinese traditional music, as can be seen in the ratio of curricula in the  educational system at music schools in China. Roughly, almost eighty percent of the curriculum is about Western music, which includes harmony, theory, counterpoint, orchestration, Western  musical form, and music history. None of these subjects, however, existed in the traditional Chinese musical system. Composers began to write music that apply Western techniques, such as counterpoint to Chinese melodies. Representative works include the Yellow River Piano  Concerto, based on the Yellow River Cantata by composer Xian Xinghai. (Ibid.). Composers like Chen Yi, Zhou Long, and Tan Dun are internationally famous.

Moreover, many people started to learn Western instruments such as piano, violin, cello, and flute, and some traveled and began to absorb influence abroad. The piano became the most popular instrument among other Western instruments. Not only are children interested in piano lessons, but keyboard-skills classes were started in the university in China recently. The famous Chinese pianists include Lang Lang and Yuja Wang. 

Historically, Western music was studied earlier in the USA  than in China since it was settled by European. However, the study of Western music in China has greatly expanded in the last half century. The ability to read music is now more widespread than in the past. In both America and  China people attend concerts like in European countries. Many new concert halls are located in  major cities, providing more opportunities to appreciate music. Two beautiful new halls are the Shanghai Opera House and the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing.


## ​Three Comparisons of Piano Study between the United States and China 

​Due to the different cultural backgrounds between America and China, there are a variety  of views about piano study. I have taught both Chinese and American students for many years. My teaching experiences and my research lead me to focus on three areas: the influence of  parents, how students are motivated, and how music study improves the students’ capacities in  other areas. 

### ​a. Parental Influence 

Parents may contribute to their children’s success in the piano study. As shown by Comeau and colleagues (2012), when parents observe their children’s lesson, the children will practice more, be interested in piano performance and creativity more, and feel more competent at the piano. Also, when parents participate, it likely gives the children a message that the parents truly believe in the value of piano playing and encourage deeper engagement on the part of the children. (Idem, 190-191)

Chinese parents are more likely than American parents to help their children with piano  practice and sit in on their children’s piano lessons. There is evidence that Asian parents generally take greater personal responsibility for their children’s education (Ibid.) The study by Stevenson and Lee (1990) comparing Asian and American sixth and seventh grade students found that:

> 47% of Asian parents, compared to 7% for American parents, were carefully structuring their children’s time so that, even out of school, they would focus on academic related skills through private lessons in music, to their children’s learning process. (Idem 66-67)

Taking my own learning experience as an example; my mother sat in when I started piano lessons. Since I was only four years old, she took notes for me and learned almost everything during the lesson  time as well, and then always sat with me to practice for two entire years. Sometimes, she even  acted as a “teaching assistant.” From what I know of other Chinese natives, this is a fairly common situation. Most of my Chinese students’ parents choose to sit in on lessons, even though many of them do not know how to play piano. The parents assist their children in every way they can, such as making notes, recording the lesson, or asking questions at the end. Most Chinese children are not as averse to it as American children.

It is important that parents and teachers communicate and cooperate in the interest of the children’s study. Younger children need more parental help than older children during the  learning process. The degree to which the student improves is closely related to the frequency with which a parent helps the children with home practice. Consequently, I believe that parental influence matters a great deal to their children’s piano study. Parental efforts may not be efficient as those of the teacher, but the children’s growth can be enhanced through this cooperation between parents and instructor. 

### ​b. Student Motivation 

My experience suggests that Chinese children are more motivated to play the piano than American children. The motivation starts with the parental influence I discussed above and joins with the student’s innate autonomous motivation.

Generally speaking, Chinese youngsters practice piano more than American youngsters. Both Chinese parents and children strongly  believe that musical training requires hard work and effort, regardless of one’s talent. Chinese children practice every day as a daily task practicing longer each day than their American counterparts. This commitment to intensive work usually gives the Chinese children an edge over American children when it comes to the basic technical skills of piano playing.

In my experience, most American children learn and practice piano for their personal pleasure. Instead of thinking of practice as a daily task, they practice because they want to do it for their inner feeling. I call it internal-factors. However, since Asian culture is collectivistic, Chinese children are more likely to be motivated pleasing their parents and teachers. I call it external-factors.

Although they may be more motivated at first to please their teachers and parents, eventually they may find an intrinsically enjoyable feeling in their faithful daily practice. Extrinsic motivation is not necessarily harmful in Asian cultures. As long as the person subjectively  distinguishes the external-factors, they can still experience the many benefits of intrinsic-factors or autonomous motivation. (Zhou et al. 2009, 492-493)

### ​c. Music Study as a Means to a Greater End 

A key regarding music study concerns the future benefits that come to other areas of life as a result of the music study. Many researchers have explored the benefits of listening to music  passively as well as pursuing music actively, as in learning an instrument.

The benefits of music in the classroom and its effects on brain development, academic performance, and practical life skills have been observed through research by Jenny Nam Yoon. She found that “the two hemispheres of the brain are stimulated when music is played and how the corpus callosum, the  bridge that connects the two hemispheres, is larger in musician's brains.” (Yoon 2000, 3-5) A 1981 study at Mission Viejo High School concluded that music students had a higher GPA than students who did not participate in music (3.59 vs. 2.91). There have been studies done verifying music as an enrichment activity that causes an increase in self-confidence, discipline, and social cohesion, as well as academic benefits. (Dearing et al. 2004, 446-7)

Although this viewpoint still has objectors, most people believe that music provides children with cognitive and emotional benefits, such as “improving spatial and temporal brain functions, which may help them succeed in other school subjects.” (Slaton 2012, 34) Socially, advocates describe music as something that provokes peace, passion, and reduces stress, which  they feel provides multiple benefits to students. (Lewis  2003, 56-7)

Since the Chinese economic reform (1978), the population has gotten richer and achieved  a higher standard of living. This allows people to focus on the establishment of a spiritual world. Especially in the late 20th century, a great many families started to let their children learn instruments.

Nowadays, music training has become increasingly common in China, even including prenatal education especially suited for mother and fetus. More and more people are learning music as a hobby, and also consider music as their future career.

Musicians in China have even achieved the status of role models. There is a policy that students can earn extra points for the college entrance examination (similar to the SAT in America) if they pass an additional exam of a special artistic skill, which includes vocal, instruments, dance, drama, calligraphy, and  painting. This additional exam exists for high school art specialty students, not art majors. Almost every high school student in China will take the national college entrance examination in order to get into a college or university; this in turn will lead to a better job after they graduate.

​Therefore, many students undertake a specialty of art in order to get a chance to earn higher scores for the examination; piano is a fashionable choice among these specialties.


## Piano Teaching Theories in the United States and China 

### a. American-Style Piano Teaching vs. Chinese-Style Piano Teaching 

American-style education believes that one can “learn from playing”, which is to say, learning should be fun. Some educational experts think that learning piano should be more like a game than a traditional “imitate the teacher” lesson. American teachers are especially focused on this when working with beginners.

I have observed American teachers make a game of learning  to learn music, putting notes or rests on cards to let children choose the correct answer. Or the teacher will give little rewards, like a little red flower decoration, when the student makes one small improvement. This could add to the students’ motivation to some extent.

Personal creativity and independence are much valued in America. As a result, children  may be allowed to choose what they want to study. American parents are not likely to force their children to continue if they no longer want piano lessons.

Moreover, American piano teachers love to arouse broader interests in students. They may introduce material beyond the major class, such as information about piano literature, and duo-repertoire class.

​In addition, many Western countries provide ensemble courses for young students in piano study to increase the cooperation ability. As a result, Western pianists generally are more experienced with ensemble music than Chinese pianists. American educators believe the goal for teaching is not only to train a soloist but also to become a comprehensive musician who can promote and preserve music. 

Chinese parents usually have higher specific goals for their children. The parents will encourage or even force them to keep learning piano when they lose interest. Chinese professional music education rarely offers chamber music or literature courses with private lessons in pre-college.

However, basic technical training is given great attention in order to cultivate the so-called talented students, who can play difficult and technically demanding pieces. The difference in educational approaches between the United States and China can be seen as early as kindergarten. Kuzmich (1995) surveyed and interviewed school music educators in both North America and China. Classes are more student-centered in America, where the  focus is on the students’ feeling and enjoyment.

But in China, classes are more teacher-centered;  the students are expected to follow the teacher’s instructions. (Ibid., 31-35) Rote learning is typical in the old  Chinese-style of learning; a student’s task is to write down or memorize whatever the teacher gives. In the piano lesson in China, imitation is the most important part of the lesson rather than  an emphasis on creative activities. Historically, Chinese teachers taught in a serious and strict  atmosphere. In old Chinese educational culture, there are many sayings like “Talented students  are trained by strict teachers”, and “Beating implies intimacy, scolding implies love.” ( These are old Chinese folk sayings that I have translated here, “严师出高徒” and “打是亲，骂是爱.” )

However, American-style education has had a major influence on Chinese education as culture globalization spreads. Now, more and more Chinese teachers focus on cultivating students’ interest and combine good aspects from both educational styles in piano studying.

### b. Piano Teaching Materials For Beginners

In China, piano teachers concentrate on the training of basic technique. During the  learning process, students are required to practice a large number of basic technical exercises. The most commonly used materials include: Bayer’s Elementary Method for the Piano, Op. 101,  Hanon’s The Virtuoso Pianist in Sixty Exercises, Czerny’s Practical Method for Beginners, Op.599, and Brahms’ Fifty-One Exercises for the Piano. All these books have become indispensable  exercises for piano students. Hanon remains part of piano practice for a long time. The scales,  arpeggios, and some exercises in the Hanon have also become obligatory parts in the test of levels for amateur players.

Chinese piano teachers believe that a student will inevitably encounter an insurmountable difficulty when he enters the intermediate level and will not be able to move much farther unless the student has a solid technical training from the beginning.

Piano education in the United States is different from other countries. It integrates education methods from around the world because the United States is an immigrant country. Especially during the Second World War, many musicians fled from all parts of the world to the United States. Musicians from other countries brought their own ethnic characteristics and educational methods to the United States. Through long use and development, these methods  were gradually codified and became accepted as the so-called American-style education. 

In the United States, there are many types of piano teaching materials available for beginners besides Bayer and Hanon. These include Piano Adventures, Bastien Piano Basics, Alfred’s Basic Piano Library Lesson Book, and The Music Tree. Each set is a series, essentially a brand, which usually consists of a main lesson book, theory or activity book, and performance or recital book. Each series proceeds in a coordinated way, but each book has its own characteristics. For example, a theory book will have some exercises like chord progression and improvising, which is lacking in the Chinese piano teaching system for beginners.

In addition, the American teacher chooses the most suitable teaching materials to guide the individual student rather than having all the students use the same type of materials. There are now many excellent  method books available. 

### ​c. Syllabi for Advanced Music-Related Classes 

In higher education in the United States, the teacher is required to provide a syllabus. Although it is a relatively new requirement, it has been widely applied in most schools. The syllabus is expected not only in the academic courses, but also in courses like the private piano lesson. It can be considered a road map or a guidebook, which leads students to understand the overall goals and requirements of a class. It also shows that the teacher has devoted detailed efforts to create the course.

As I remember university in China, we did not have syllabi for any of our classes. From what I know of current China, the syllabus is still not commonly used yet. Only a few schools have started to apply the syllabus, like the Wuhan Conservatory of Music.

Here I have included a sample syllabus for Piano Literature I (_Figure 1_). It gives a general idea of what contents a teacher should include in a syllabus. (I created this syllabus as an assignment in the “The Teaching Performer” class, taught by Dr. Lani Hamilton, at UMKC. It is the result of research that examined many syllabi, including those for history classes, piano literature class, and Dr. Hamilton’s sample syllabi. The syllabus that follows was accepted as an assignment in the class.)

Course Description: 
This course is designed to enhance the knowledge, appreciation, and understanding of piano literature from the late Renaissance to Romantic period. The participation and team presentation require the students' take part in the class as much as possible and demonstrate what they have learned from the class. You will discover some music which you did not know before, and gain new insights into works with which you were already familiar. By the end of the course, you should have a comprehensive understanding of the development of the piano, a wide variety of composers, genres and styles, and corresponding works through reading, analysis, listening. presentation, and exams. 

Student Learning Outcomes: 
Students will discover a great amount of music from Renaissance to Romantic period. 
Students will understand the developmental history of the piano. 
Students will know a wide variety of composers. 
Students will explore as many as genres and styles possible.
Students will identify music by ear and by score. 

Requisite Materials: 
Magrath. Jane. The Pianist's Guide to Standard Teaching and Performance Literature. California Alfred Pub. Co., 1995. 
Gordon, Stewart. A History of Keyboard Literature: Music for the Piano and Its Forerunners, New York: Schirmer Books, 1926. 

Some scores are available in PDF format on the listening list posted on Blackboard. 
NOTE: Students will be asked to purchase some scores as needed. Like Mozart Sonatas, and Beethoven Sonatas. My Assumption for serious musicians who will be interacting with this music for a lifetime should make a long-range plan to build their own library. 
Assignments
Responses to Readings and Team Presentations

Responses to Readings: 
For ten of the assigned chapters or articles, please submit a two-paragraph response for each on Blackboard. These are due the day for which the chapters are assigned weekly. Your responses should convey one paragraph brief summary of the content and the other paragraph is your subjective response to it. 

Team Presentations: 
Presentation No. 1 Representative Works Review from 1600-1750 
Presentation No. 2 Representative Works Review from 1750-1900 

In groups of two people, prepare a fifteen-minute oral presentation on two representative works from each of the above appointed time-period. Each group member chooses one work, then analyses and compares the two works together. It could include any information related to the piece, e.g. compositional background, form, genre, special character, specific terms, etc. But the content must be compact, and points have to be related closely. During your comparative analysis of the two works. Nate what you think is similar or different, and what made them significant. This should be a group presentation in the form of a dialogue with appropriate musical examples, and must include a typed handout. You can either play the excerpts of recordings or play by yourself. Your handouts should not be a copy of the text that you read in front of the class, but should outline the main points and include other relevant information that is better transmitted visually than verbally. Each person must contribute meaningful content to the presentation. You will want to meet as a team in advance to plan your presentation. These two presentations will happen respectively two weeks before the midterm and final exam. 
Attendance:
1-2 unexcused absence ----- No impact
3 - 4 unexcused absences  ---- Final grade drops 1/3 of a GPA per absence (ex. A to A-, A- to B+) 
5+ unexcused absences ----  Automatically count as Grade F
