	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<div>
		The text examines the phenomenon of categorical perception of musical pitch
		as defined by John Sloboda (1999), Jane A. and William Siegel (1977), Stefan
		Koelsch (2012), and William Yost (2013), in their researches in the field of
		music psychology. The paper states the hypothesis that the current system of
		dividing the octave in twelve equal semitones do not employ the human
		physical capabilities for defining pitch to their full extend. On the
		contrary, the reviewed literature testify for the existence of a strong
		tendency to categorically label and perceive non equally tempered intervals
		with different but close to each other magnitudes (widths) as the same. This
		tendency is stronger in professionally trained musicians than in
		non-musicians. A short historical excursion to the 21 tone 1/6 syntonic coma
		meantone temperament, recommended by both Leopold (1856) and Wolfgang
		Amadeus Mozart (1965), is included as an example for better utilization of
		the musicians’ potential to distinguish pitch and intervals, which had been
		employed in practice. The text continues with a brief overview of the theory
		behind generating intonations and temperaments, based on the Equal Division
		of the Octave (EDO) method. Finally, a short exemplary reference to Kyle
		Ganns’ cycle “Hyperchromatica” (2015) is made alongside with quoting his
		personal attitude and commentary towards the performers’ general interest
		for microtonal music. The paper concludes that the categorical perception of
		pitch in the context of the twelve-tone equal temperament may be regarded as
		the main challenge, which the microtonal music is facing.
