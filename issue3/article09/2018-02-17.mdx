	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<div>

    	Smiljana Mandukić (1908-1992) a dancer, choreographer, and teacher, was among those dancers who pioneering the modern dance in Serbia. The beginning of the 20th century brought new forms of art as the old ones were not sufficient to express new feelings and experiences, in that era of rapid technological progress. Mandukic was educated as a dancer in interwar Vienna, so she happened to be at the centre of Central European expressionist dance, free dance, at the time of her formation as a dancer. Smiljana acquired dance knowledge from her teachers, famous dancers and choreographers, Gertrud Bodenwieser, who developed her own style of modern expressionist dance, known as “Bodenwieser Viennise Style”, and Grete Wiesenthal, who was a member of the corps de ballet of the Hofoper in Vienna (Vienna Court Opera Ballet). Both her teachers were the representatives of “Ausdrukstanz” or “Neur Tanz”, and were rejected formalism and virtuosity of classical dance in favour of more natural movements. Like her pair, Maga Magazinovic (1882-1968), who introduced expressionist dance in Serbia, established the first school of modern dance in 1910, and founded the first modern dance group consisted of female dancers, Mandukic advocated for the importance of dance in education of female population. In the traditional, patriarchal Serbian society, she opened the second school of modern dance in 1931, and was the first artist who established a professional group of modern dance. Her greatest achievement was the creation of “epic-patriotic choreodrama”. The main goal of this article is to confirm that Smiljana Mandukic’s pioneer work in establishing modern dance in Serbia was the part of the European expressionist modern dance movement of the equal importance and significance not only when considering the Western Balkans but the broader European context.

## Introduction

In the beginning of the 20th century Smiljana Mandukic weaved a provocative thought of free dance movement in her homeland and its cultural-artistic courses, at the time when the modern dance was being developed and taking its significant place in Europe. Due to the fact that she grew up in Vienna and that she was a Vienna student, she was formed under the strong influence of the artists who were either her teachers or influenced on establishing and developing of the unique Vienna modern dance scene, such as Grete Wiesenthal (1885-1970), Gertrud Bodenwieser (1890-1959), Elinor Tordis, Émile Jaques-Dalcroze (1865-1950), Rudolf Laban (1879-1958) Isadora Dunkan (1877-1927), Max Reinhardt (1873-1943), and Hugo fon Hofmanstal (1874-1929). Pioneer artistic practice of Smiljana Mandukic was definitely under the strong influence of the above-mentioned prominent Europeans from the field of modern dance and theatre.

## Mandukic’s Education and Development of Modern Dance Style

<div className='floatBox'>

Smiljana Mandukic (_Figure 1_) was educated as a dancer in interwar Vienna, so she happened to be at the centre of Central European expressionist dance, free dance, at the time of her formation as a dancer. Smiljana acquired dance knowledge from her teachers, famous dancers and choreographers, Gertrud Bodenwieser, who developed her own style of modern expressionist dance, known as “Bodenwieser Viennise Style”, and Grete Wiesenthal, who was a member of the corps de ballet of the Hofoper in Vienna (Vienna Court Opera Ballet). Both her teachers were the representatives of “Ausdrukstanz” or “Neur Tanz”, and were developed under the influences of Isidora Duncan, Rudolf von Laban, Mary Wigman, and Ruth St. Denis, who rejected formalism and virtuosity of classical dance in favour of more natural movements.

Since being educated in German language and cultural environment, Smiljana Mandukic adopted alternative direction of expressionist dance, Ausdruckstanz, as a new view of art which she brought to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and Serbian region. She acted under the influence of Viennese school of dance and choreography by rejecting what was felt as artificial to the body in classical dance, tamed by strict discipline, technique and figure.
