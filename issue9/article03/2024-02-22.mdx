	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<div>

    	Turandot has long been criticized as artificial, anti-feminist, and most notoriously, Orientalist. The goal of this paper is to show from a survey of its numerous adaptations and transformations worldwide, that it has been proven more productive to treat it as a case for the complexity of the discussion on authenticity of a piece of art in an ever-changing and global world, instead of simply dismissing it as an attestation of Puccini’s inability to produce an authentic montage of a place no different than “a galaxy far, far away” for a Nineteenth century Italian. The paper concludes that over the course of the last two decades, Turandot has transformed from a piece used by the West to appropriate Chinese, to a self-appropriating piece that helped mainly China to assert its “cultural soft power,” and eventually to a vehicle for Chinese domestic audience to understand more about both themselves and the West, and the common thread uniting both cultures: humanity and love.
