	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<div>

    	The sociocultural impact of the Odabara dance on the evolution of culture in the Ikem community, Isi-Uzo Local Government Area of Enugu State, is examined in this paper. The dance, which dates back to 1975, is analyzed in terms of historical influences, cultural synthesis, and its reaction to societal changes. Its rise to prominence in radio broadcasts in 1980 is considered a turning point in its history. The Odabara dance is presented as an artistic response to societal changes, a reflection of regional traditions in expressive arts, and a contribution to the community's cultural repertory. Through its symbolic gestures, rhythms, and stories, Odabara's cultural significance is explored, presenting it as a dynamic and alive cultural artifact forming the identity of the community. The study acknowledges its historical influence on prosperity, fertility, and fortune, as well as its role in criticizing socially unacceptable practices. But issues that could jeopardize its survival are brought to light, including caregivers' passing, disinterest, learning curves, and lack of mentorship. The Odabara dance is a vibrant representation of the identity of the Ikem community and has great historical and cultural significance. For maintaining cultural continuity, the current difficulties highlight the necessity of concerted efforts in recording, preservation, and rehabilitation. It was suggested that initiatives to document and preserve the knowledge associated with the Odabara dance, such as oral traditions, dance steps, and educational materials, be accomplished to preserve the musical culture of the community. Community engagement, as well as the promotion of community engagement and awareness programs, along with other things, will further the sustainability of the musical culture in Nigeria.

## Introduction

African music's intricacy and cultural diversity weave the continent's history, customs, and identities together like a vibrant tapestry. Since music is an artistic expression that embodies the values, stories, and philosophies of all cultures, it is an essential component of cultural history. Within this broader context, Nigerian traditional or indigenous music plays a significant role, representing the vast ethnic and linguistic diversity of the nation. African dance can be divided into three categories: traditional, modern, and contemporary. The dance steps that are the result of indigenous and local creativity are known as traditional dances. While contemporary dances are dance steps that have changed from currently popular traditional dances, modern dances feature dance steps produced by individuals or groups using their creative inventiveness.

Many indigenous musical traditions that hold great cultural significance are found in Nigeria, a country renowned for its vast cultural diversity. Oral history, rituals, and social norms are passed down through these conventions to future generations. The study's main focus is on the sociocultural influence of the Odabara dance on the development of culture in the Ikem community in the Isi-Uzo Local Government of Enugu state, Nigeria. This study clarifies the role traditional dance and music play in preserving and advancing regional culture.
In the South-East of Nigeria, traditional dances are especially important because they represent the spirit of the people and their way of life. Nigerian traditional dance is a vibrant and essential part of the nation's rich cultural legacy, acting as a dynamic expression of the histories, values, and identities of diverse communities.

Nigerian traditional dance is a vibrant and essential part of the nation's rich cultural heritage, a dynamic expression of the histories, values, and identities of various communities. Traditional dances are especially important in the South-East region of the country, where they represent the spirit of the people and their way of life. Traditional dance in the South-East region of Nigeria is a multifaceted art form that encompasses a wide range of styles, each uniquely tied to the cultural heritage of specific ethnic groups. Notable ethnic groups in this region include the Igbo, who contribute significantly to the diverse tapestry of Nigerian traditional dance.

One of the biggest ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Igbo people, have a rich dance heritage that represents their customs, festivals, and social ideals. The "Ikpirikpi-ogu," also known as the War Dance, is one of the most famous types of traditional Igbo dance. This dance is distinguished by its forceful motions, coordinated steps, and drumbeat rhythm. In the past, it was a show of bravery, preparedness for combat, and warrior honor (Okafor 2005).

The Igbo people celebrate a wide variety of dance forms for different occasions, in addition to the War Dance. One well-known Igbo tradition is the "Ekwe" dance, which is performed at social gatherings and involves dancers using wooden instruments to create rhythmic sounds. Another well-known Igbo tradition is the "Mmanwu" masquerade dance, in which masked performers embody ancestral spirits and interact with the community during festivals and ceremonies (Anyanwu 2011).

Traditional dances in the South-East region are not just forms of entertainment; they are meant to transmit cultural values, history, and communal solidarity. These dances are frequently entwined with religious ceremonies, rites of passage, and significant life events, connecting the past and present. South-East Nigerian traditional dance is a vivid illustration of the depth and diversity of the nation's culture. These dances are essential to the preservation and continuation of cultural heritage, because they are firmly anchored in the history and beliefs of the ethnic communities. South-East Nigerians continue to place much importance on traditional dances as vibrant manifestations of communal identity and celebration.

Nigerian traditional music is notable for its diversity, representing a range of geographies, tongues, and cultural customs. These musical expressions come in a diverse styles, from poetic lullabies to lively dancing rhythms, and each has a unique cultural purpose. The Odabara dance, one of these forms, is a poignant example of a dance custom closely associated with the identity, culture, and way of life of the Ikem people.

The people of the Ikem community have a particular place in their hearts for the Odabara dance. It promotes a sense of belonging, honors their cultural distinctiveness, and symbolizes their history. Through this dance, people pass on valued beliefs to future generations, connect with their roots, and share experiences as a community. The Odabara dance is a representation of the dynamic interaction between music, dance, and culture. It functions as a means of conserving the past while addressing the issues of the present.

Like many other communities in Nigeria, the Ikem community has a rich cultural legacy passed down through the ages. The Odabara dance symbolizes the history, social standards, and values of the community through its unique beat, dances, and symbolic gestures. It is a living monument to the community's collective memories and identity, as well as a form of artistic expression. The dance is frequently a means to promote cultural continuity and community cohesion at events including festivals, celebrations, and get-togethers.

## Theoretical framework

According to Social Cohesion Theory, social rituals like traditional dances are essential for promoting harmony and togetherness within a community (Smith 2005). Customary dances, which are marked by group involvement and common experiences, are essential for fostering a strong feeling of community among community members and cementing social ties (Durkheim 1893). The general growth and well-being of the community are greatly enhanced by this communal involvement. According to the notion, interpersonal interactions are improved, and a collective identity that transcends individual differences is reinforced when social cohesion is attained through shared cultural practices like traditional dances (Putnam 2000). Mutual knowledge of cultural norms and values is strengthened as community members partake in these shared activities, which helps to create a strong sense of social cohesion (Helliwell, Putnam, & Thórisdóttir, 2020).

Additionally, traditional dances foster a sense of solidarity that can be used as a source of social capital for community development programs (Coleman, 1988). In this context, social capital is defined as the networks, trust, and shared values that arise from communal activities, like dancing traditional dances, and which can be utilized for problem-solving and collective action (Bourdieu 1986). By promoting a feeling of cohesion, shared identity, and social capital among its members, traditional dances help communities grow and thrive (Smith op.cit.). This is best understood through the lens of social cohesion theory. This hypothesis will be used in the study to determine how dancing contributes to the sociocultural development of the Ikem community, Isi Uzo Local Government Area of Enugu State.

## Literature review

Cultural dance has its historical roots in society's customs and practices (Jones 2017). Smith (2018) claims that dance was a ceremonial practice used by ancient civilizations like the Greeks and Egyptians to help communities connect with their spiritual beliefs. African dance frequently plays a significant narrative role that allows spectators to understand specific facets of local culture. It represents their worldviews, their primary vocation, and their ideals regarding politics and religion. From the beginning, many scholars, like Layiwola (2000), have described Nigerian dances as "speculative," making assumptions or maintaining opinions not backed up by data. Clark (2000), claims that Nigerian dance was once a ritual. It all started with the:

> early religious and magical ceremonies and festivals of the Yoruba, Egwugwu and Mmo masquerades of the Ibo, and the Owu and Oru water masquerades of the Ijaw. [according to Clark (Ibid.)]

Two other scholars who support the ritual origins of dance are Mbiti (1990), who notes that dancing is one of the many ways that Nigerians express their intense religiosity, and Okoye (2000), who characterizes dance as "primarily ritualistic."

In addition, Mbiti (Ibid.), observes that Nigerians' dancing is a reflection of their intensely religious way of life. Dance facilitates the relationship between the material and incorporeal realms. As stated (Monyeh 2007):

> dance is an avenue for total expression of the natural and the supernatural. A masquerade in its performance communicates to the living and the underworld. In this case, there is the relationship with the world of the living and the world of the spirit. The body could make the invisible concrete, thus creating a completely self-contained world for dancers in which they can perform physical feats and prowess, which are far beyond normal daily occurrence or normal movement. (Ibid., 111)

Examining the historical foundations, social roles, and continuous evolution of dance in the face of globalization are necessary in order to comprehend the cultural value of dance. This survey of the literature also looks at the wider cultural relevance of dance, exploring its historical origins and development, before focusing on examining various perspectives on dance in particular cultural situations.

In Nigeria, dance is closely related to both religious and cultural customs. Every ethnic group in Nigeria has its own distinctive dances, which are frequently used for social bonding, storytelling, or worship (Adedeji 2015). The "Igogo" dance of the Igbo people is performed during significant rituals and festivals, whereas the Yoruba people's "Gelede" dance honors female ancestors and celebrates feminine virtues (Oladele 2012). The multitude of dance styles in Nigeria are a reflection of the country's cultural richness, each adding to the lively cultural mosaic of the nation. The Yoruba "Gelede" dance is a colorful and elaborate performance that honors female ancestors and praises feminine values (Ibid.). This folk dance is frequently distinguished by its vibrant costumes, ornate masks, and energetic moves. The "Gelede" dance's main goals are to respect women's powerful roles in society and to call forth the power of female deities, especially the Yoruba goddesses. As a form of cultural expression that upholds gender norms and societal values, the dance is frequently performed at festivals and other special events.

The Igbo "Igogo" dance and the Yoruba "Gelede" dance are essential parts of their respective cultures' cultural fabric. The Yoruba "Gelede" dance honors female ancestors and celebrates feminine virtues, whereas the Igbo "Igogo" dance is a dynamic expression of social, religious, and cultural significance during significant rituals and festivals. These dances demonstrate the complex and varied ways that dance is used to communicate meaning, preserve legacy, and fortify community ties, in addition to showcasing the diversity of Nigerian cultural traditions.

Conversely, the Igbo people execute the "Igogo" dance at important rituals and festivals (Ibid.). Drumming, vibrant clothing, and rhythmic motions define this dance. Within the Igbo community, "Igogo" has cultural, religious, and social significance. It is frequently done to commemorate significant life events, like marriages, deaths, or group gatherings. The dance transmits ancestor tales and customs from one generation to the next, aiding in the preservation of culture.

#### Fertility, Wealth, and Fortune

The Odabara dance was believed to bring blessings of fertility, wealth, and fortune to the community. Its practice was associated with positive outcomes that contributed to the overall prosperity of the community.

## The current state of the Odabara dance practice

The current state of the Odabara dance practice in Ikem reveals a complex interplay of factors that have contributed to changes and adaptations, ultimately impacting the preservation of this cultural heritage. Several key factors, namely the death of members, lack of interest and followership, difficulties in learning the dance steps and playing the instruments, as well as the mentorship absence, have collectively influenced the transformation of Odabara dance within the community.

The Odabara dance's continuity has been severely harmed by the passing of those who served as its guardians. There's a chance that with every person that leaves, important details, subtleties, and nuances related to the dance will be lost. The legitimacy of traditional behaviors depends on this component of cultural transmission. The passing of members — especially those who looked after the Odabara dance — has emerged as a crucial element in the major obstacles and changes to the survival of this cultural heritage in Ikem. This phenomenon is not limited to the actual loss of individuals; it also includes the possibility of important knowledge, subtle understanding, and detailed information related to the dance disappearing. The loss of custodians has a significant and varied effect on the authenticity of the Odabara dance, as well as the cultural transmission.

The keepers of the Odabara dance serve as dynamic archives of cultural information. They are the living embodiment of the historical tales, accumulated wisdom, and minute intricacies that make up the dance. With their dying, this living archive will be lost, endangering the flow of important ideas that might not be recorded elsewhere.

### Oral Tradition and Unwritten Knowledge

Much of the knowledge associated with traditional dances like Odabara is often transmitted orally. Custodians play a crucial role in orally passing down the dance steps, rhythms, meanings, and historical context to the next generation. The death of custodians disrupts this oral tradition, leading to potential gaps and omissions in the transmission of unwritten knowledge.

#### Nuances and Intricacies: Symbolism and Cultural Nuances

Traditional dances often carry layers of symbolism and cultural nuances that may not be explicitly codified, but are deeply embedded in the practice. Custodians, through years of experience, understand the subtle meanings behind each movement and musical element. Their absence risks a loss of these intricate cultural details that contribute to the richness of the Odabara dance.

#### Stylistic Elements and Techniques

The dance steps, stylistic elements, and techniques associated with Odabara are unique to the community and have evolved over generations. Custodians possess a mastery of these elements, having learned and refined them through personal experience. The death of custodians may lead to a dilution of the dance's authentic style, as nuances are lost in subsequent generations.

#### Impact on Cultural Transmission: Break in Inter-generational Transmission

The death of custodians creates a generational gap in the transmission of cultural knowledge. Younger members of the community may not have direct access to the insights and experiences of those who were intimately involved in the practice of Odabara. This break in intergenerational transmission hinders the seamless transfer of the dance's essence.

#### Risk of Misinterpretation

Without custodians to guide the learning process, there is an increased risk of misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the Odabara dance. Those elements, once performed with specific cultural meanings, may lose their intended significance, leading to a potential distortion of the dance's true essence.

The death of members, especially those who have served as custodians of the Odabara dance, poses a significant challenge to the continuity and authenticity of this cultural tradition within Ikem.

#### Lack of Interest and Followership

A decline in interest and followership within the community has contributed to the waning practice of Odabara dance. As younger generations become less engaged or interested in preserving cultural traditions, the dance loses its community support and participation, leading to a diminished cultural impact.

#### Difficulties in Learning Dance Steps and Playing Instruments

The intricate nature of Odabara dance steps and the skill required to play accompanying instruments may pose challenges for new learners. Difficulties in mastering these elements may deter individuals from actively participating, leading to a potential loss of the dance's traditional form.

##### Lack of Mentorship

The absence of mentorship creates a gap in the transfer of knowledge from experienced practitioners to younger generations. Mentorship is crucial for maintaining the nuances, symbolism, and cultural meanings embedded in the Odabara dance. Without mentors, the dance risks becoming a mere shell of its original self.

#### Perception of Problems

The community members perceive these factors as significant problems that pose a threat to upholding their cultural heritage. The dwindling vibrancy of the community and the erosion of the Odabara dance's true form contribute to a sense of cultural loss. Moreover, the decline in the practice of Odabara dance is associated with the rise of undesirable practices within the community, indicating that the dance once played a crucial role in critiquing and mitigating such behaviors.

### Exploring the perceptions and attitudes of community members

The current state of the Odabara dance in Ikem community presents a stark contrast to its historical practices, raising concerns about its functional continuity and the transmission of its cultural significance. While some argue that the Odabara dance has become theoretical, with a lack of practical manifestation and dwindling knowledge among the younger generation, others attribute its decline to external influences such as globalization and modernization.

#### Lack of Continuity and Knowledge Transmission: Practical Aspect and Knowledge Transmission

The observation that no one continues the practical part of the Odabara dance lends credence to the claim that the dance has become theoretical due to a lack of engagement in real life. Odabara is becoming less and less common in the community since less people are aware of it.

#### Limited Awareness among the Younger Generation

The argument that the younger generation is not actively engaged in sustaining the Odabara dance tradition is substantiated by the observation that many in the current generation are unfamiliar with the dance. Lack of awareness and participation among the youth contributes to the decline of the tradition.

#### Contributions to the Precipitation

Some proponents suggest that the younger generation's lack of engagement in the dance directly contributes to the downfall of Odabara. Without active participation and interest, the dance loses its community-wide significance and support.

## External Influences and Modernization

### Impact of Globalization and Modernization

There is evidence that other dance forms are becoming more popular, which supports the claim that external influences like industrialization and globalization have affected the Odabara dance. The emergence of popular music-inspired dance moves and Western dance steps has drawn focus away from traditional dance techniques.

### Loss of Originality through Western Instruments

It is believed that the transition from indigenous instruments to Western instruments such as drum kits, keyboards, and guitars is an indication of the influence of outside forces. It is argued that this change hastened the Odabara dance's downfall by changing its real nature and original essence.

### Acculturation and Mixture of Dance Steps

The observation of the merging of traditional and contemporary aspects supports the claim that the Odabara dance has undergone acculturation, incorporating a variety of modern dance techniques. The original form and cultural meaning of the dance may be lost as a result of this hybridization.


_______________________________

## Conclusion

The Ikem community's Odabara dance is a vibrant representation of their identity and history, with great historical and cultural value. Its inception in 1975 and development since then show a creative fusion of regional traditions, historical inspirations, and expressive arts traditions. The dance is a priceless cultural asset because of its clear effects on the social cohesiveness, ceremonial rituals, and cultural identity of the community. Nonetheless, there are issues with the Odabara dance nowadays that put its survival in jeopardy. Changes in the practice of the dance raise questions regarding its cultural transmission and functional continuity, including the death of custodians, lack of enthusiasm, learning challenges, and lack of mentorship. To guarantee that the Odabara dance maintains its depth, significance, and cultural relevance for upcoming generations, these difficulties highlight the necessity of concerted efforts in documentation, preservation, and cultural revival.

#### Reccomendation

Implementing strategic efforts that actively involve the community in the process, while also documenting and preserving the accompanying information, is essential to preserving the rich African musical culture centered in the Odabara song of the Ikem people. We may build a thorough archive for next generations by documenting dancing moves, recording oral traditions, and producing teaching materials. To sustain our lovely musical tradition and spark interest in it among the younger generation, in particular, the engagement of the whole community and awareness campaigns will be essential.

The importance of traditional dance can be imparted to community members through workshops, seminars, and cultural events. By establishing mentorship programs, the cultural tradition will be revitalized and sustained by facilitating the information transfer from seasoned practitioners to the youth. Furthermore, gaps in the transmission of information can be filled by promoting intergenerational collaboration through the development of venues for experience exchange.

It is vital to maintain the authenticity of traditional dance. This means preserving the customary dance steps, instruments, and costumes, while fending off outside influences that can weaken the dance's original shape and cultural importance. Cultural awareness initiatives within the community can draw attention to the dance's historical and cultural significance, empowering its participants to feel proud of and responsible for it.

Projects aiming at recording and conserving traditional dance will require finance, which would further require outside assistance, such as grants for study and documentation. Enhancing these efforts can be possible through collaboration with cultural organizations and academic institutions, which can offer extra resources and experience. The community may actively endeavor to preserve the African traditional dance and guarantee its continued status as a lively and enduring reflection of our cultural heritage by carefully implementing these guidelines.
