	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<div>
		The aim of this study is to empirically investigate the impact that the
		period of learning of Indian Classical art form Bharatanatyam creates on the
		Spiritual intelligence of the students. Primary quantitative data has been
		collected using closed-end survey from 180 students pursuing Bharatanatyam
		from higher education institutions in India. The variable Spiritual
		Intelligence has been measured through 24 item SISRI scale. The moderating
		effect of the gender of the student has also been examined in this research.
		The statistical analysis of the primary data collected reveals that higher
		the years of learning of Bharatanatyam by an individual, higher is the level
		of Spiritual intelligence of the individual. It has also been revealed that
		out of the four constructs tested in this research to measure the variable
		Spiritual intelligence the construct critical existential thinking has
		greater significance when compared with that of the other three constructs
		namely transcendental awareness, conscious state expansion and personal
		meaning production. The study also reveals that gender does not moderate the
		relationship between Spiritual Intelligence and the number of years a person
		has been practicing and performing Bharatanatyam.
