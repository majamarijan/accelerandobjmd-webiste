	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<div>
		There is the need to re-examine what was previously held as age-old truths
		in the light of new findings; the issue of music and its use in our
		contemporary societies is one of such. For example, there was a general
		assumption that music making has no side effects and that everyone enjoys
		music. Today, musicogenic epilepsy stares at our faces and we have come to
		know that such beliefs are not truly so. Without contradiction, music
		features in major activities in our daily living. The avenues for music
		making in traditional societies are gradually being taken over by the
		churches, club houses, social and cultural organisations with high wattage
		of volumes. This development has some negative effects on human and
		environmental health. This study uses a descriptive research method which
		entails quantitative and qualitative designs. Data were elicited through
		participant observation, interviews, review of apt literature and
		questionnaires. A4D Tuner, a tool for measuring sound pressure levels was
		used to assess the volume of sounds often emitted in certain social and
		other gatherings. It was observed that most of the musical avenues visited
		emit sounds which are far above the recommended 75dB as stipulated by the
		World Health Organisation (WHO). The work predicts that bathing people or
		the environment with excessively high volume of sounds will in no time
		engender physical and emotional disturbances, neural deafness and even total
		deafness. Consequently, it suggests that the government should make adequate
		legislation on sound pollution to arrest this malaise.
